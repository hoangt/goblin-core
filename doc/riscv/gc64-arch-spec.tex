\section{Introduction}

\subsection{GC64 Overview}

The GoblinCore-64 (herein referred to as GC64) that was originally designed to 
facilitate the construction of a high performance core architecture that was
well-suited to executing applications traditionally known as "data intensive."  
These applications generally refer to algorithms that operate on sparse
data structures such as graphs, sparse matrices and/or perform nonlinear 
combinatorial operations (et.al.).  We consider all of the aforementioned target
application areas to share the following two general characteristics.  

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Non-Unit Stride}: All of the applications we consider as design targets
for GC64 perform a disproportionate number of non-unit stride computations.  These 
  computations may simply be non-unit stride, scatters, gathers or completely random. 
  In all cases, the data elements are not generally well-suited to traditional 
  long SIMD or data caching architectures.
\item  \textbf{Memory Intensive}: Given the first characteristic, we also assume
  a latent characteristic with respect to the memory bandwidth requirements.  
  Given the sparsity or non-linear access requirements, we assume that the design 
  targets operate with a disproportionally high bandwidth to compute ratio.  As
  such, we consider them to be memory intensive rather than computationally
  intensive.  
\end{itemize} 

In addition to the core design requirements, we also sought to build a
completely open source architecture and tool chain suitable for architectural 
research in academia and possible commercial implementations.  As such, we sought
to build BSD-like licensing around the core ISA, simulation infrastructure, tools
and toolchain.  Given this, we found that our implementation goals aligned 
well with the RISC-V project \cite{Waterman:EECS-2014-54}.  These include, but are
not limited to the following: 

\begin{itemize}
\item A completely \emph{open} ISA that is freely available to academia and industry.
\item An ISA separated into a \emph{small} base integer ISA. 
\item Support for the revised 2008 IEEE-754 \cite{2008IEEE} floating-point standard.
\item An ISA with \emph{native} support for highly-parallel multicore or many core
implementations.  
\end{itemize}

In addition to the core RISC-V goals, we also wanted to achieve the following
architectural goals (as related to our target design requirements): 

\begin{itemize}
\item Provide simple architectural structures that are conducive to constructing
  highly (MIMD) parallel and concurrent applications
\item Provide simple ISA extensions conducive to compiler optimization of
concurrent applications
\item Provide a low-level, mutable parallel construct in hardware that can
  be easily mapped to higher level parallel programming models (threads, tasks, etc)
\item Provide hardware mechanisms to minimize context switch latency to a very small
  number of cycles (goal of single cycle context switching events)
\item Provide a well-defined mechanism when context switch events occur
\item Provide a well-defined mechanism for user applications to explicitly induce
  context switch events
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RISC-V ISA Requirements}

The GC64 RISC-V extension functions as both a core RISC-V \cite{Waterman:EECS-2014-54} architectural extension and an extension to the standard 64-bit RISC-V IMAFD specification.  The following minimum architectural extensions are required to utilize GC64.  

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RV64I}:  GC64 requires 64-bit addressing at minimum.  The RV32I memory model is supported as a result.  However, given the use of HMC devices, we require the use of at least 64-bit addressing (and addressing arithmetic).  
\item \textbf{M-Extension}:  GC64 requires the integer multiplication and division for the purpose of efficiently performing address manipulation.  
\item \textbf{A-Extension}: GC64 requires the atomic instructions.
\end{itemize}

The following architectural extensions are supported in the GC64 tasking model.  They are herein named as optional extensions.  

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{F-Extension}:  By default, the GC64 task context definition supports the storage of the single precision floating point register values.  If the F-extension is not present, these values are ignored.  
\item \textbf{D-Extension}: By default, the GC64 task context definition supports the storage of the double precision floating point register values.  If the D-extension is not present, these values are ignored.  
\item \textbf{RV128I}: By default, the GC64 reuqires 64-bit addressing.  However, when building scalable versions of GC64 in large SMP or PGAS modes, it may be desirable to support 128bit addressing.  
\end{itemize}

%--- GC64 SoC Architecture
\subsection{GC64 SoC Architecture}

%------ Overview
\subsubsection{Overview}

The GC64 SoC architecture consists of six hierarchical units that
are explicitly organized to provide high degrees of local and global
concurrency without sacrificing performance.  The hierarchy of
architectural units organized from smallest (least encompassing)
to the largest (most encompassing) is depicted in the table below.
Note that each subsequent layer encompasses one or more units from
the previous layer.  At least one of the lower four architectural
layers must be included in all GC64 configurations.

\begin{center}
\begin{itemize}
\item Task Unit [required]
\item Task Processor [required]
\item Task Group [required]
\item Socket [required]
\item Node [optional]
\item Partition [optional]
\end{itemize}
\end{center}

%------ Task Unit
\subsubsection{Task Unit}

The GC64 \emph{Task Unit} is the smallest unit of divisible concurrency.  
The task unit consists of the  RISC-V integer register file, the RISC-V
floating-point register file, the GC64 user-visible registers and the GC64
machine state registers.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gc64-task-unit.png}
\caption{GC64 Task Unit}
\end{center}
\label{figure:taskunit}
\end{figure}  

%------ Task Processor
\subsubsection{Task Processor}

The GC64 \emph{Task Processor} consists of the basic integer and floating-point 
arithmetic units, a thread control unit and one or more task units.  The thread control 
unit is essentially an ALU dedicated to managing the state of the task units.  This includes
the following functions: 

\begin{itemize}
\item Spawning new tasks
\item Joining executing tasks
\item Incrementing the task execution pressure [\emph{gcount}]
\item Enforcing context switch events
\end{itemize}

The task processor is permitted to execute instructions from a single task unit on any given 
cycle.  In this manner, each task processor is myopic in its focus.  It is the job of the thread control
unit to enforce which task unit is in \emph{focus} on any given cycle.  Any time the thread control 
unit switches focus from one task unit to an adjacent task unit, we refer to this event as a
\emph{context switch}.  The thread control unit may select a new task unit only 
from the task units that are directly attached.  GC64 requires that at least one task unit
exist per task processor.  GC64 permits a maximum of 256 task units per task processor. 

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gc64-task-proc.png}
\caption{GC64 Task Processor}
\end{center}
\label{figure:taskproc}
\end{figure}  


%------ Task Group
\subsubsection{Task Group}

The GC64 \emph{Task Group} consists of one or more task processors interconnected to a
local memory management unit (MMU).  This MMU serves two purposes.  First, it determines
whether a request is designated as a local request or a global request.  Local requests are 
serviced by either the on-chip scratchpad memory or one or more HMC interfaces.  Global 
requests are serviced by off-chip resources.  

The second major task of the local MMU is request coalescing.  Memory requests from 
multiple tasks across multiple task units and task processors are coalesced into larger 
request packets in order to optimize channel bandwidth utilization.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gc64-task-group.png}
\caption{GC64 Task Group}
\end{center}
\label{figure:taskgroup}
\end{figure}  

%------ Socket
\newpage
\subsubsection{Socket}

The GC64 \emph{socket} consists of a single GC64 system on chip (SoC) module.  This module 
consists of of one or more GC64 task groups.  These task groups are integrated via a network on 
chip interface to four shared on-chip components.  These components as described as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Scratchpad:} The on-chip software-managed scratchpad unit acts as a very high performance, 
user-mapped storage mechanism for commonly used data
\item \textbf{Atomic Memory Operation Unit:} [AMO]Controls queuing, ordering and arbitration of atomic memory operations
\item \textbf{HMC Channel Interface:} One or more HMC channel interfaces handle the protocol interaction to/from one or more HMC devices.  
\item \textbf{Off-Chip Network Interface:} The off-chip interface handles any off-chip memory requests that utilize the GC64 memory addressing mechanisms.  
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gc64-socket.png}
\caption{GC64 Socket}
\end{center}
\label{figure:socket}
\end{figure}  

%------ Node
\newpage
\subsubsection{Node}

The GC64 \emph{node} architecture consists of one or more GC64 socket modules that reside on a single node addressing domain.  These modules may be locally interconnected or physically co-located on a singular PCB.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gc64-node.png}
\caption{GC64 Node}
\end{center}
\label{figure:node}
\end{figure}  


%------ Partition
\newpage
\subsubsection{Partition}

The GC64 \emph{partition} consists of one or more GC64 nodes that share a top-level addressing domain.  The partition may also contain a link to an adjacent partition or partitions for the purpose of sending and receiving memory traffic.  

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{gc64-partition.png}
\caption{GC64 Partition}
\end{center}
\label{figure:partition}
\end{figure} 

%--- GC64 Memory Organization
\subsection{GC64 Memory Organization}

\subsubsection{Memory Architecture}

The GC64 memory architecture and hierarchy is designed
to promote efficient utilization of system bandwidth resources
for highly concurrent applications that operate in a non-deterministic
fashion with respect to memory request traffic.  The memory hierarchy
consists of three main components with an optional fourth component. 
The three main components consist of the memory management unit (MMU), 
the software-managed scratchpad memory and one or more Hybrid Memory
Cube (HMC) devices.

The task group MMU serves two main purposes.  First, it serves as a 
memory coalescing point for all tasks in the respective task group.
The coalescing logic is designed to build larger request payloads, where
applicable, in order to service multiple individual memory requests with 
a single HMC payload.  The MMU also determines whether an individual 
memory request is designated as \emph{local} or \emph{global}.  Local
requests are those requests that are serviced by any HMC device or software 
managed scratchapd that is directly attached to the respective socket.  
Global requests are those that must be routed off-socket and thus serviced by 
adjacent sockets, nodes or partitions. 

The software managed scratchpad is the second component in the mandatory 
memory hierarchy.  The software managed scratchpad serves a purpose similar to 
a traditional data cache in that it contains frequently used data items that
can be read or written to via any of the tasks in an application's process space.
However, it differs in the sense that the actual logic associated with populating
the scratchpad is serviced via software mechanisms in the programming model, 
as opposed to explicit circuit logic.  In this manner, the user and programmer
have explicit control over what and where certain items fall closer to the task 
units in terms of the overall memory hierarchy.  

The final unit in the memory hierarchy is the HMC device.  The HMC devices
may be interconnected directly or via routed devices (devices connected
via other HMC devices).  The GC64 microarchitecture does not prevent
any standard HMC configurations. 

The fourth [optional] unit in the memory hierarchy consists of a the ability 
to performance global addressing of system archtiectures that contain multiple
nodes and/or partitions.  This capability provides shared and partitioned addressing
of an entire system via an \emph{extended} 128-bit addressing format 
[described below].

\subsubsection{Physical Addressing}

The [local] physical addressing format is designed to support locally scalable
(within a node) memory addressing the directly maps to the vault-interleaved
nature of the HMC devices.  The local physical memory address format consists
of four fields as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Base Address:} The base address is a 34-bit physical address unit
that maps directly to the HMC specification's base physical addressing field.  
\item \textbf{CUB:} The CUB or Cube ID field maps to the HMC request payload's 
definition of a Cube ID.  This is a unique identifier that is local to each GC64
socket.  One Cube ID maps to a single HMC device.  GC64 reserves the Cube ID
\emph{0xF} for the respective socket's scratchpad memory.  
\item \textbf{Reserved:} This field is currently unused, but reserved for future
expansion
\item \textbf{Socket ID:} This 8-bit field identifies the socket ID within the GC64 node.
Given that the base physical address and the CUB field are socket-local, this field
will designate addressing into devices beyond that of the local socket.  
\item \textbf{Unused/Ignored:} Bits [63-50] are ignored in the current GC64
microarchitecture.  They are neither zero nor sign extended.  This field is simply
ignored.  
\end{itemize}

\end{center}

\subsubsection{Extended Physical Addressing}

The extended physical addressing format requires the optional 128-bit addressing
mode (based upon the RISC-V 128-bit addressing mode).  In this mode, global 
addresses are formed using a base 64-bit addressing payload and an extended
64-bit addressing payload.  The extended payload consists of two additional
fields that permit applications to directly access the physical memory hierarchy
of adjacent nodes and/or partitions.  The extended physical addressing fields
are designated as follows: 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Node ID:} This 16-bit field designates a remote node ID that 
may contain one or more GC64 sockets (with attached memory hierarchies).  
\item \textbf{Partition ID:} This 16-bit field designates a remote partition
that may contain one or more GC64 nodes (each of which contain one or more 
sockets).
\item \textbf{Unused/Ignored:} The upper 32 bits of the extended address are ignored
\end{itemize}

\section{GC64 Instruction Set Extension}

The GC64 RISC-V instruction set extension can be classified as a \emph{brownfield extension} with respect to the machine state.  In this manner, all the instructions fit within the existing RISC-V encodings.  However, the GC64 extension does instantiate additional machine state in terms of user-visible and non user-visible registers.  

\subsection{GC64 RISC-V Machine Organization}

\subsection{GC64 Register State}
In addition to the registers defined as a part of the base RISC-V IMAFD ISA, we define an additional set of registers for the GC64 extension.  The register extension is defined in terms of User-Visible, Supervisor and Machine-State registers.  User-Visible registers are those that can be read and written from normal user instructions.  Supervisor registers are those that can only be read and written from supervisor-privileged instructions.  Machine-State registers cannot be read or written from any instruction space.  Rather, these registers are implicitly modified during the normal operation of the core.     

\subsubsection{User-Visible Registers} 
The GC64 extension adds a register, \emph{tctx}, to the list of user-visible registers.  The \emph{tctx} register is an unsigned 64bit register that exists per task and contains the base address of the task that is currently loaded in the task unit. The \emph{tctx} register can be read from and written to using user-privileged instructions.  However, given that it resides outside the base RISC-V IMAFD register set, it can only be read from and written to using the \emph{gettask} and \emph{settask} instructions.  

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{TCTX}
\end{center}

The GC64 extension adds a task ID register, \emph{tid}, to the list of user-visible registers.  The \emph{tid} register contains an unsigned 64bit value that represents the task ID currently loaded in the respective task unit.  The \emph{tid} registers can be read from a single user-privileged instruction, \emph{gettid}.  

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{TID}
\end{center}

The GC64 extension adds a task queue register, \emph{tq}, to the list of user-visible registers.  The \emph{tq} register is an unsigned 64bit register that contains the address of the primary task queue.  The \emph{task queue} register can only be read from normal user mode using a single instruction, \emph{gettq}.  It cannot be written to from normal user mode.  It can only be written from supervisor mode using a single instruction, \emph{settq}.  

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{TQ}
\end{center}

The GC64 extension adds a task exception register, \emph{te}, to the list of user-visible registers.  The \emph{te} register is an unsigned 64bit register than contains the address of the task exception queue.  The task exception queue contains task contexts that have encountered an exception state or breakpoint (during debugging).  The \emph{task exception} register can only be read from normal user mode using a single instruction, \emph{gette}.  It cannot be written to from normal user mode.  It can only be written from supervisor mode using a single instruction, \emph{sette}.  

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{TE}
\end{center}

The GC64 extension adds a configuration register, \emph{gconst} that is user-visible.  The \emph{gconst} register is an unsigned 64bit register that contains the identity parameters for the containing task unit and GC64 processor.  The \emph{gconst} register can only be read.  It cannot be written to.  It can only be read via the \emph{getgconst} instruction.  The \emph{gconst} register contains the following fields.  

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Mnemonic & Bits & Size [Bits] & Description \\ 
\hline \hline
TU & [7:0] & 8 & Task Units ID [hardware] \\
\hline
TP & [15:8] & 8 & Task Processors ID \\
\hline
TG & [23:16] & 8 & Task Group ID \\
\hline
SID & [31:24] & 8 & Socket ID \\
\hline
NID & [47:32] & 16 & Node ID \\
\hline

\hline 

\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{GCONST}
\end{center}

The GC64 extension adds an architecture description register, \emph{garch} that is user-visible.  The \emph{garch} register is an unsigned 64bit register that contains the configuration parameters for the containing task unit and GC64 processor.  The \emph{garch} register can only be read.  It cannot be written to.  It can only be read via the \emph{getgarch} instruction.  The \emph{garch} register contains the following fields.  

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c | c |}
\hline
Mnemonic & Bits & Size [Bits] & Description \\ 
\hline \hline
NTU & [7:0] & 8 & Number of task units per processor \\
\hline
NTP & [15:8] & 8 & Number of task processors per group \\
\hline
NTG & [23:16] & 8 & Number of task groups per socket \\
\hline
NS & [31:24] & 8 & Number of sockets per node \\
\hline
NN & [47:32] & 16 & Number of nodes per partition \\
\hline
NP & [63:48] & 16 & Number of partitions \\
\hline 

\end{tabular}
\end{center} 

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{GARCH}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Supervisor Registers}

The GC64 extension contains a single supervisor register.  This register is contained within each task unit and is referred to as the \emph{gkey} register.  The purpose of this register is to contain the security key loaded via the kernel and constructor routines at application launch such that rogue tasks cannot spawn tasks in the process space of a neighboring process.  Given the purpose of this register, it remains a part of the standard context for context save and restore operations.  This register is represented using as an unsigned 64bit value.  It can be read from and written to using the supervisor instructions \emph{gkey} and \emph{skey}.  

\begin{center}
\makebox[\textwidth][s]{63 0}
\framebox[\textwidth][c]{GKEY}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Machine-State Registers}

The GC64 extension contains a single machine-state register.  This register, known as the \emph{gcount} register, is not directly readable or writable from any instructions.  Its value is similar in function to a traditional performance counter register.  Any time an instruction is retired through the pipeline, this value is incremented.  The increment value is dependent upon the cost of the retired instruction.  Once this counter reaches its maximum value as defined by the internal architecture state, the encountering task unit is forced to context switch and thus permit another task unit to execute.  The only method the user-privileged code has to indirectly access this register state is the \emph{ctxsw} instruction.  The \emph{ctxsw} instruction explicitly sets this register to its maximum value, thus forcing a context switch event.    

\newpage
\subsubsection{GC64 Register Indexing}
A summary of the permissible GC64 register indices is as follows.
Note that all register follow a 5-bit encoding schema in order to adhere
to the base RISC-V \emph{R-Type} instruction encoding.  
Note that all supervisor registers appear in the index range above 0b10000.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l | c | c | }
\hline
Mnemonic & Index & Access \\ \hline
\hline
tctx & 0b00000 & User,Supervisor \\
\hline
tid & 0b00001 & User,Supervisor \\
\hline
tq & 0b00010 & User,Supervisor \\
\hline
te & 0b00011 & User,Supervisor \\
\hline
gconst & 0b00100 & User,Supervisor \\
\hline
garch & 0b00101 & User,Supervisor \\
\hline
gkey & 0b10000 & Supervisor\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


%------- INTEGER LOAD/STORE INSTRUCTIONS
\subsection{Integer Load/Store Instructions}

The integer load and store instructions require a full 32-bit
instruction encoding space.  We utilize the standard RISC-V
\emph{R-type} ISA encoding format for each of instructions.  In
this manner, all the integer load and store instructions support
three operands and no bundled immediate values.  All explicit index
values for scatter/gather store/load operations must be explicitly
loaded to an integer register (\emph{x0-x31}).

The following load and store instructions share the same base
opcode, but differ in their funct7 field encodings.  The instruction
encoding space is depicted as follows:

%-- integer gathers
\subsubsection{lbgthr rd, rs1, rs2}

Perform a one-byte \emph{gathered load} operation of the address and
index \emph{rs1} and \emph{rs2}, respectively, and store the result

the programming model(s) achieves parallelism and concurrency.  The limit of the
documentation generally stops at instruction level parallelism (ILP) or multi-core
connectivity to shared caches.  However, the GC64 microarchiture extension is
explicitly designed to foster highly efficient parallel software development.
As such, we explicitly outline the mechanisms by which the software and the
instruction set may interact with the inherent hardware concurrency mechanisms 
(eg, \emph{task units}). 

\subsection{Task Context}

\subsection{Task Queuing}

\subsection{Context Save/Restore}

\subsection{Task Instruction Return Values}

The task control instructions \emph{spawn} and \emph{join}
attempt to increase and decrease the concurrency of a given
application context, respectively.  Note the definition of these
instructions.  Each of the aforementioned instructions returns a value
in the target integer register that is essentially a return code that
describes the status of the given operation.  The return values are signed
64-bit values.  This is true in both the base 64-bit addressing mode 
and the optional extended 128-bit addressing mode.  The full list of 
return values is as follows: 

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c |}
\hline
Mnemonic & Value & Description \\ 
\hline \hline
TFATAL & -1 & A fatal error occurred in the operation\\
\hline
TOK & 0 & No error occurred.  The operation was successful\\
\hline 
TNULL & 1 & Task queue was previously null (no queued tasks)\\
\hline

\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{History and Acknowledgements}

This project is sponsored by the Data Intensive Scalable Computing Laboratory in the Whitacre School of Engineering at Texas Tech University.  The original GoblinCore64 Instruction Set Architecture and concept began in 2013 as a stand-alone ISA without dependence upon any external projects.  However, given the emergence of the RISC-V project from the University of California, Berkeley, and the inherent synergies with their design decisions, we decided to migrate the base GC64 ISA to the RISC-V infrastructure.  We would like to thank the members and collaborators associated with the RISC-V project for their diligent effort to build, document and distribute the RISC-V ISA.
