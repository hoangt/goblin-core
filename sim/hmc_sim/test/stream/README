HMCSIM TEST: STREAM
-------------------------------------------
Executes a Stream Triad against a target
HMC-Sim configuration
-------------------------------------------

I.	Overview
-------------------------------------------

Executes a stream triad against a target 
HMC-Sim configuration.  The stream triad
can be summarized as follows: 

a[i] = b[i] + scalar * c[i];

Depending upon the target host architecture, 
the algorithmic loop construct may be 
executed using SIMD, MIMD or purely scalar
techniques.  This test supports both the 
notion of SIMD, MIMD or both.  The test 
assumes that the memory pipeline and/or MMU 
has the ability to support all the 
incoming requests from an abitrary number 
of threads.     

II.	Building
-------------------------------------------

In order to build the Stream Triad test, 
you must first build the libhmcsim.a
library object.  This can be done using
the makefile at the top level of the
HMC-Sim source directory.  

Once you have built the libhmcsim.a 
library object, you can build the 'stream'
executable using the local makefile.  
Type 'make' to build the executable.

III.	Execution
